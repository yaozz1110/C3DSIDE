# C3DSIDE：Unsupervised Single Image-based Depth Estimation Powered by Coplanarity-Driven Disparity Derivation
Xiaoling Yao, Lihua Hu, Yang Ma, Jifu Zhang

Our model, along with all related methods, was developed using Python 3.8 and
the PyTorch[45] framework, with the implementation carried out in the PyCharm
Integrated Development Environment (IDE). All models were trained and evaluated
on a system running Ubuntu 20.04 (Linux) with a single Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080
Ti GPU.
